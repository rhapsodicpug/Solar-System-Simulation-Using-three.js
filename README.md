3D Solar System Simulation using JavaScript Library Three.js
Special thanks to Ankit Jha for his incredible work on the original Three.js Solar System simulation. Exploring his project helped me better understand how to structure 3D scenes, apply textures, and animate planetary orbits using Three.js. This version reflects my own learning and customization based on that foundation.
